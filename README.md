# Classification-of-Arrhythmia-in-Heartbeat-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
In this project, we build an effective electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia classification method using a convolutional neural network (CNN), in which we classify ECG into seven categories, one being normal and the other six being different types of arrhythmia using deep two-dimensional CNN with grayscale ECG images.
